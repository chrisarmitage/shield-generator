Shield Generator

The result of playing with the HTML5 Canvas API. Also planned to help me practice my Git / GitHub.

Generates simple heraldic shield designs.

It's been a great exercise in learning the Canvas API, but Javascript is just too unwieldy for the
direction the project is going in. I may come back and play with it again, but as it stands, the
code is going to be ported over to PHP / GD.
